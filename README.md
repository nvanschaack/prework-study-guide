# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This is a study guide to help beginning web developers understand some of the basic and most commonly used languages in the world of coding. This project was created to document some useful information I learned in my personal journey of coding. I wanted to make it publicly available so that other beginning web developers can have access to material that may also help them in their new career. This specific project highlights useful pointers in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript languages. Being introduced to these languages has taught me that coding uses a broad range of tools, both simple and complex.

## Usage
There are four sections of this study guide; **HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript**. Each section contains notes on the different and important aspects of that particular language. In order to view a list of topics I learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first, open the Chrome DevTools console by pressing `Command+Option+I` (macOS) or `Control+Shift+I` (Windows). This feature is made possible by JavaScript!
